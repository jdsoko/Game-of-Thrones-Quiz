# Game of Thrones Quiz

This is a fun little quiz I made about one of my favorite television shows, Game of Thrones. 
There are a lot of small details that one could miss while watching the show and still manage 
to understand and enjoy it, so I thought it would be fun to program a quiz that tests people's
knowledge of somewhat obscure facts from the show/books. 

It was also made with the purpose of testing my jQuery skills and practicing DOM manipulation.

The most challenging part of making the quiz was the fact that prior to doing the majority of 
my CSS stylings, I made sure to fully implement the javascript so that I knew that quiz was fully
functioning from start to finish. For the purpose of actually selecting answers to submit, I initually 
used a form with the default radio buttons, but I really didn't want to keep the actual circle button, 
and it ended up being difficult for me to remove the button but still have the answers selectable.
